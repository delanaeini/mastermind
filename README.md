## How to play

The computer has stored four random digits in its memory, and your job is to guess what they are. 
For every digit that you guess right but is not in the correct position, you will get an 'x', and for every digit you guess right and it is in the correct position, you will get an 'o'
The order of 'x's and 'o's will be random. You will not get a feedback for incorrect digits.
You can enter 'Q' to quit, or keep guessing until you get the digits (and their positions) right.
**Note that the computer might have stored the same digit in multiple positions!**
